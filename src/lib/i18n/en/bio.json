        "short": "The Nari Baroque Ensemble is a young ensemble specialized in early music performance, based in Jerusalem, Israel. Since our debut in Decemeber 2019, we have been working hard on establishing and refining our special approach to drama and emotion in music and text, aimed at drawing our listeners into a strong emotional experience. This approach led to many successful performances of our English baroque program Love and Prejudice, culminating with an acclaimed performance at the Felicja Blumental Music Festival 2021. We have received first prize for ensembles at the Tel Aviv Recorder Festival 2021, and we recently performed our debut at the Jerusalem Music Center, broadcast live on the radio.We are currently touring with our new program Cupid: Devil or Angel, based on music from the Italian baroque."
